🚀 AI-Powered Travel Planning Application 🚀

Excited to share my project on an AI-driven travel planner that helps users find optimal travel options between a source and destination. This system leverages LangChain and Google GenAI to generate various travel choices—cab, train, bus, flights—along with their estimated costs.

🔍 Project Objectives:
✅ Develop an AI-powered application for efficient travel planning.
 ✅ Utilize LangChain for managing LLM-based user interactions.
 ✅ Integrate Google GenAI for intelligent data processing & response generation.
 ✅ Provide a user-friendly Streamlit interface for seamless interaction.

🏗 System Architecture:
🔹 User Input: Source & destination provided via a web-based UI.
 🔹 Processing: LangChain & Google GenAI handle the request.
 🔹 Response: AI generates structured travel recommendations with estimated pricing.
 🔹 Output: User receives optimized travel options.

⚙ Tech Stack:
💻 Python | 🎨 Streamlit | 🧠 LangChain | 🌍 Google GenAI
